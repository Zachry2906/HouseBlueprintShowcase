# Web for house blueprints marketplace

This phone-based web was created for the final project of my friend's digital transformation course who is studying architecture.

This phone-based web is build with only HTML, CSS, tailwindCSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Thus, this code is very redundant. There's so many code and line in HTML that can be separated as component. But since i created it just with HTML, i have difficulty in doing the separation into components 

This is just a simple web phone, not all the features in it can be used 100% because I only have time to make it in 2 weeks, but thankfully my friend got an *A* grade in that course 

## Installation

Use [gitbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) to clone project.

## Usage
